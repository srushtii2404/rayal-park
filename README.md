# rayal-park

I created a hotel eCommerce website for a business named "Rayal Park" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a modern, user-friendly interface designed to showcase the hotel's services and amenities. HTML was used to structure the content, while CSS was implemented to style the pages, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout. JavaScript added interactivity, such as image sliders, booking forms, and dynamic features, enhancing the user experience. The website enables customers to easily explore room options, view details, and make reservations, providing a seamless and engaging platform for the Rayal Park hotel.
